Program made a few months ago more or less in December 2020,
when I was learning python by myself. This program encourages manipulation
of data structures like dictionaries, lists and some functions like file handling.
As I am programming on top of a linux OS, the program will not run if you are trying
run it on a windows or Mac unless you change the files extension in the programs to as .txt type, I think that's enough.
It answers questions based on a list of questions already defined.
